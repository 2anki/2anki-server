# Development

Make sure you use [nvm][0] to avoid possible issues due to versions.
To get started you can start off by installing the dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Frontend

The frontend is using React and you can get it up and running

```
cd web/
npm run dev
```

## Backend

This code was moved to a private repository and is currently a submodule.
When some of the security issues have been resolved it will be moved back
in. Hopefully very soon.
